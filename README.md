This is a fast paced cafe game where you interact with customers, fill orders, and keep the cafe clean!

**HOW TO PLAY**

At the top are four buttons, "Dining room", "Bakery", "Drink Station", and "Counter". 
Your job is to move between the four screens to keep the cafe running!
What exactly is the goal, you may be asking?
You want to check the dining room, if you see a cookie on any of the four tables, click that table five times to clean it! Over time, the tables will become dirty again, so be sure to check!
On top of keeping track of the tables, you also have to serve customers. Go to the counter screen, where you'll find a customer making a request for a specific drink and food. These are all represented by emojis!
Once you know what the order is, go to the corresponding room using the navigation buttons on the top.
You can follow the instructions to prepare the item! Please keep in mind, for drinks you have to select a type as well as a flavor. 
Once you finish preparing the items, select them from your inventory on the right! Please note you may only have one food and one beverage selected at a time.
To serve, return back to the counter room with the items highlighted to serve them to the customer! 
You have two chances to get the order right, then the customer will leave.
One more thing, if you take too long to prepare an order, than the customer will lose patience and leave!

Think you have what it takes to run the bakery?
